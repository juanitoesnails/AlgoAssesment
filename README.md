Hi Welcome to my little repo,

Currently working on some small projects!

Next patches: Unit Testing! Gonna be adding some unit tests to the repository soon.
Structure: Gonna have the dashboard and the classes in a src file. Streamlit is pretty strict with the structure so the dashboards need to be at the root of the repo.


Next project: Using hip hop and billboard lyrics to forecast stock prices!
